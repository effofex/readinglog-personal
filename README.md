# readinglog-personal
Holds the templates and associated resources used to make my own readinglog

This is really intended for me to easily move template files between machines and take advantage of versioning, but it may be useful as a unsupported example as well.

If you want to make your own #readinglog, you're probably going to be more interested in [this repository](https://github.com/effofex/readinglog).
